# GridWorks Architecture

GridWorks is designed as an automation layer for the Rebar ecosystem rather than as another collection of faster machines.

## Design rules

1. **Keep the control core independent.** The public control-bus API and graph engine do not depend on Bukkit, Rebar, Pylon, electricity, cargo, or fluids.
2. **Integrate through adapters.** Rebar blocks and future electricity, logistics, fluid, and machine integrations sit at the edge of the control system.
3. **Do not call addon code while holding topology locks.** Dispatch snapshots its route first, then invokes receivers after releasing the graph lock.
4. **Bound all propagation.** A configurable hard cap prevents a single signal from traversing an unexpectedly huge network in one dispatch.
5. **Suppress graph duplicates.** A node receives a publication at most once even when the network contains cycles.
6. **Prefer events over global polling.** Future sensors should use native change events where available and use configurable scheduled sampling only when necessary.
7. **Do not force chunk loads.** Future physical networks should operate on loaded state and recover cleanly as chunks load and unload.
8. **Keep upstream-sensitive code isolated.** Rebar electricity is under active development, so electricity-specific code belongs behind a bridge instead of leaking into the core API.

## Control bus

The first implementation is an undirected graph of registered `ControlNode` endpoints. A publication contains:

- a UUID identifying its source node;
- a namespaced `ControlChannel`;
- a typed `ControlValue`;
- a monotonically assigned sequence number for that server session.

A breadth-first traversal snapshots reachable recipients. The source is not sent its own signal. Cycles are de-duplicated by node UUID. Receiver exceptions are isolated and reported in `ControlDispatchResult` without preventing delivery to healthy recipients.

## Public API

Public addon contracts live under `io.github.wickidcow.gridworks.api`.

GridWorks publishes its `ControlBus` through Bukkit's `ServicesManager`, allowing another plugin to obtain the service without depending on the concrete graph implementation.

## Electricity

Electricity integration is intentionally not compiled into the first foundation build. Rebar's electricity implementation is still evolving upstream. When its addon-facing contract stabilizes, GridWorks will add a bridge for grid measurements, smart breakers, branch limits, load shedding, and power-aware factory rules without changing the control-bus core.
